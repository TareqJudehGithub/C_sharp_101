Variables
 - A place (named memory location) in memory/RAM to store values in.
 - Variables can store any type of value.
 - One variable can store one value.
 - Data types describes variables.
 - when compiling using CLR, local variables are stored in a memory 
   location called the stack.
 - When compiling is done, all variables stored in the stacked are deleted.
 - Variable must be declared before using it.
 - Variable must have a data type.
 - Example of a variable declaration
    int myNum;
 - To initialize a variable, we must include it's data type and value.
    [type] [identifier] = [value]
    int myNum = 10;


Variable rules
 - Spaces, duplications, and keywords are not allowed for naming variables.
 - Variables cannot contain special characters (except _underscore).
