Variables
 - A place (named memory location) in memory to store values in.
 - Variables can store any type of value.
 - One variable can store one value.
 - when compiling using CLR, a local variables are stored in a memory 
   location called the stack.
 - When compiling is done, all variables stored in the stacked are deleted.
 - Variable must be declared before using it.
 - Variable must have a data type.
    int myNum;
 - To initialize a variable, we must include it's data type and value.
    int myNum = 10;
