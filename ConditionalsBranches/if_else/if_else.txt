if/else statements (Branches)
 - Branches in C# means to do conditionals  (if, else if, and else).
 -  A boolean is a variable that can have one of two values: true or false. 
 - An if statement evaluates a boolean expression value.
 - If the boolean expression value in the if statement is true, the statement between 
 two parentheses {} executes. Otherwise, it's skipped.
 - If the boolean expression condition in the if statement was false, then
   the next condition wil be evaluated (the else if).
 - else keyword. Since the if and else if statements are not met, the else statement
   block of code will run.


    int a = 5;
    int b = 6;

    // Check if a is greater than b
    if (a > b && b >= 1)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{a} is greater than {b}!");
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{b} is greater than {a}");
    }
