Levels of code block

 - Here you see three levels of code blocks, starting from the inner-most code block and working our way outward:

		a method Main()
		a class Program
		a namespace MethodsClassesNamespaces
 
 - As you build real applications, you'll write methods, and organize them into classes and namespaces.

Methods
 - A method is a code block that is a unit of execution. 
 -  In other words, once the method is called by its name, the entire method will execute until:
		the runtime encounters the return keyword, or
		the runtime encounters an exception and can't continue, or
		the runtime successfully executes each line of code in the method

 - The method's name Main() is special. When the program is executed, by default the .NET Runtime will search for a method named Main() to use as the starting point, or entry point, for the program.

 Class
  - A class is a container for members like methods, properties, events, fields, and so on. 
	- We can create instances out of classes.

namespace
 - A namespace disambiguates class names.
 - When you create a new project using the dotnet CLI or the full Visual Studio IDE, it will automatically create a namespace using the project's name.
 - You can create additional namespaces in your code as needed, and can create a hierarchical series of namespaces by using the dot operator.
 - A namespace is a place to hold projects.
		 namespace MyNewApp.Business
		{
		  // Classes here    

public keyword
 - public keyword gives access to other class codes, methods, and propeties.

using statement
 - The using statement helps the compiler resolve namespaces, but requiring fewer keystrokes.
 - The using statement is added to the top of a code file.
 - It resolves the class names that are used in the file, instructing the compiler to look at the list of namespaces to find all of the class names.
 - The using statement tells the compiler to look here when attempting to resolve any class names it needs to find.
 - using System;
	It makes it possible to call Console.WriteLine() instead of System.Console.WriteLine().
