What is a code block?
 - A code block is one or more C# statements that define an execution path.

Variable Scope?
 - Variable scope is the visibility of the variable to the other code in your application.
 - A locally scoped variable is only accessible inside of the code block in which it's defined.
 - If you attempt to access the variable outside of the code block, you'll get a compiler error.
 - To make a variable visible inside and outside of a code block, you must define the variable outside of the 
   code block.
 - Don't forget to initialize any variables whose value is set in a code block, such as an if statement.

		bool flag = true;
        int value = 0;   // Don't forget to initialize this variable.

        if (flag) {
            value = 10;
            Console.WriteLine($"Inside of code block: {value}");
        }
        Console.WriteLine($"Outside of code block: {value}");
