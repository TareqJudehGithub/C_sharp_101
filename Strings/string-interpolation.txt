String Interpolation
 - To combine many literal strings and variables into a single formatted message.
 - String interpolation combines multiple values into a single literal string by 
   using a "template" and one or more interpolation expressions. 
 - An interpolation expression is a variable surrounded by an opening and closing 
   curly brace symbol { }.
 - The literal string becomes a template when it's prefixed by the $ character.
