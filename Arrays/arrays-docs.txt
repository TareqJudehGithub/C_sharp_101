Arrays
 - The Array class contains methods that we can use to manipulate the content, arrangement, and size of an array. 

Sorting item in arrays
 - Array.Sort(arrayName) methods sorts out elements inside an array in an alphabetical order.

Reversing items in arrays
 - Array.Reverse() method reverses the elements orders in an array

Clearing/removing an element from an array
 - The Array.Clear(arrayName, starting index, ending index) method allows us to clear the value of specific elements in our array.
 - Here we're using the Array.Clear() method to clear the values stored in the elements of the pallets array 
 -  the elements still exist, but they're now empty.

Empty string versus null
 - When you use Array.Clear(), the elements that were cleared no longer reference a string in memory.
 -  The value stored in pallets[0] (the cleared element value) after being cleared is null.
 - Null points to no reference in memory.
 
Resizing arrays
Array.Resize(ref ArrayName, new array size number);
Array.Resize(ref myArray, 5);
 - Here, we're calling the Resize() method passing in the myArray array by reference, using the ref keyword.
 - The new elements will be null until we assign a value to them. 

 - If we resized to a smaller number of the original array size, the elements at the end of the array will be removed.
