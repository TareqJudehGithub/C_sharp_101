Integral types
 - An integral type is a simple value data type that can hold whole numbers.
  - There are two subcategories of integral types: signed and unsigned integral types.
  Signed integral Types
   - A signed type uses its bytes to represent an equal number of positive and negative numbers.
  
  Unsigned integral types
   - An unsigned type uses its bytes to represent only positive numbers. 

   - You can use the MaxValue and MinValue properties of numeric data types to evaluate whether a number can fit in a given data type.
