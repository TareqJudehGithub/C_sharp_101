How do you choose the right data type?
 - Choose the data type that has the desired value range as a built-in constraint in your application.
 - Don't choose the data type based on what you perceive will be the impact to performance (at least, not at first).
 - Choose the data type based on the impact to other systems such as long-term storage in a database. 
 - When in doubt, stick with the basics. 
    - int for most whole numbers
    - decimal for numbers representing money
    - bool for true or false values
    - string for alphanumeric value
 
 - Choose specialty complex types for special situations.
