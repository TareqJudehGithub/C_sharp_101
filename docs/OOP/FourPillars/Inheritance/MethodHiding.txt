Method Hiding
  - Method Hiding allows the derived class to define a method with the same name 
    as the method in the base class.
  - Method Hiding, hides (does not execute) the base class method, but it invokes the derived 
    one instead.
  - Method Hiding is achieved using 'new' keyword.
  - 'new' keyword hides (but does not override) the base class method by creating a new 
    method in the derived class with the SAME name and parameters of the base class 
    method.
  - The new child method prevents the parent method from execution.
  - We use 'Method Hiding' in case we did not wish to run the parent class method.
