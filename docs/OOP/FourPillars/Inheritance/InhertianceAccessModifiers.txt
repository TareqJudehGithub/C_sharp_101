Access Modifiers In Inheritance

  In order for inheritance to work, both base and derived class must have the same access
  modifiers.
  
  public
    - Public members of the base class are accessible in the derived class.    
  protected
    - Protected members of the base class are accessible from the derived class and its
      subclasses, but not from outside the class.
  private
    - Private members of the base class are not accessible in the derived class and 
      cannot be inherited.
