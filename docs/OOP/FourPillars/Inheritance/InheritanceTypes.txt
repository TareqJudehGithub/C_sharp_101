 - Types of inheritance
  - In C#, we only have single class inheritance, C# does not support class multiple 
    inheritance.
  - C# does not support class multiple inheritance because that will lead to a diamond
    problem.
    A diamond problem is when the engine cannot decide which derived method to execute.
  - C# supports multilevel inheritance.

  - Single Inheritance
    - One parent class 

     class Person 
      {

      }  
      class Teacher : Person
      {
        
      }
  
  - Multi-level Inheritance
    - One parent class, one child class, and the child class has another child 
      class.

    - Hierarchal Inheritance
        class Person 
        {

        }  
        class Teacher : Person (parent)
        {
          
        }
        class Professor : Teacher (parent)
        {

        }
    
    - Multiple Inheritance
     - A child class has multiple parents.
     - In C#, we have to use the 'interface' keyword in order to implement
       multiple inheritance.
     - Multiple parent classes are not allowed in C#, but multiple interfaces are.  
        interface Person
        {

        }
        interface Teacher
        {

        }
        class Professor : Person, Teacher

    - Hybrid Inheritance
     - A combination of two or more types of inheritance

      class Person
      {}
      class Teacher: Person                     (Hierarchal)
      {}
      class Professor: Teacher                  (Hierarchal)
      class EnglishProfessor: Professor         (Multi-level)
