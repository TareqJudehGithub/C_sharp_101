'base' keyword
  - 'base' is a keyword available in the derived class that enables it to 
     have access to the base class members.
  - The 'base' keyword always refer to the base class members, and not the child's.
  - The use of 'base' keyword is optional, we can still access the parent class 
    members without the use of 'base'.
  - 'base' is useful when both the parent and child has a class member with the 
    same name.

    //(this is the constructor)
      public ChildName(param1, param2): base (param1: param1, param2: param2) 
          {
            // code
          }

    // Base class Method
    public void BaseClassMethod
    {
      // some code
    }
    // Derived class method
      public void DerivedClassMethod
      {
        // This will invoke the base method instead of the derived one.
        base.BaseClassMethod();
      }
