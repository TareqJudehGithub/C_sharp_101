Abstraction
 
 - through Abstraction, a class can hide sensitive and private data and prevent access 
   from outside its class.
 - Abstraction is the concept of providing only limited data or actions to 
   instead of providing everything there to outside the class.
 - Abstraction keeps fields secured and safe from outside access.  
 - Abstraction reduces complexity and code repetition, and increases efficiency.
 - The code outside the class can access only its public data but 
   not the private data/actions.
 - Private fields/methods can be called as part of the public methods indirectly.
 - So, from outside the class, we can call a method, and that method
   can call other private fields and methods. 
 - Always create fields as private, and access them through public methods
   using 'get' and 'set' methods.
