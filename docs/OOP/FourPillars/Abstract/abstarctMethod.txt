Abstract methods
 - An abstract method, is declared in the parent abstract class.
 - In a normal class, we cannot implement an abstract method.
 - An abstract method (in the abstract class) has no method body (block of code).
 - The abstract method body is provided by the derived class.
 
    public abstract class MyClass {  
      public abstract string MyMethod(string param1, ..);
    }
 
 - The child class of an abstract parent class, must implement
   the body of an abstract method.
 - we must use 'override' keyword to implement the method of the
   child class.
 - 'override' means that we are following the method signature of
   the parent abstract class.
 - The method name, parameters, and return type must identical in both the parent 
   and the child abstract class.

   public class ChildClass : ParentClass
    {
      public override string MyMethod(string param1, ..)
        {
          // method body
        }
   }

   public class ChildClass : ParentClass
    {
      override  (method names will appear)
      
      public override string MyMethod(string param1, ..)
        {
          // method body
        }
   }

   Summary:
    1- Create an abstract method (without a body) in the parent
       abstract class.
    2- Create an abstract method in the child class with 'override'
       keyword. This method will be containing the method body.
    3- remember, methods in the parent and in the child class share 
       the same name, parameters, and return type.  
    4- Instantiate and call the method from the child class.
