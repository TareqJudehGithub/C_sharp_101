abstract modifier
 - Abstract class is a parent class, of which we cannot instantiate/create
   objects off.
 - abstract keyword is a modifier of the abstract class.
 - abstract keyword prevents a class from being instantiated.
 - Use abstract for parent classes.
    internal abstract class MyClass {
      // code here
    }
 - It is recommended to abstract parents classes, and instantiate from child ones.
 - We cannot create objects off an abstract class directly.
 - We can add abstract methods in the abstract class, and we can also add concrete
   methods as well.
 - abstract methods should always be public, so other derived classes can access it.  

   public abstract class MyClass
   {
    public abstract MyAbstracMethod();
    public void MyConcreteMethod()
    {
      Console.WriteLine("My concrete method.");
    }
   }
