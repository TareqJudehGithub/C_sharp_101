Polymorphism 
 - Polymorphism is the provision of a single interface to entities of different types.
 - Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common
   base type.
 - Polymorphism comes from the greek words Poly (many) and morphe (shape).
 - Polymorphism is achieved through inheritance, through method overriding and 
   overloading.


Types of Polymorphism
 - Run-time Polymorphism (Method overriding)
    
 - Compile-time Polymorphism (Method overloading)
