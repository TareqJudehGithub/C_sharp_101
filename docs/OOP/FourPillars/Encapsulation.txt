Encapsulation
 - Encapsulation binds data (fields) and actions (methods).
 - Encapsulation bundles data with methods that operate on this data  (in single class).
 - Encapsulation enables data hiding.
 - Encapsulation provides safety.
 - Using Encapsulation, we indirectly access fields through
   Setters and Getters methods. So we protect fields from 
   accessing them directly.

 Setters and Getters methods

 Setters
  - Set methods sets values into declared fields.
      public SetFieldName(dataType value){

      }
   
   Why do we have to copy the parameter value into it's respective field?
   - value is short-live parameter which will be removed/deleted
     after method execution is over.
   - Parameters are stored inside the stack.

   Getters
    - Getters return the value of field declared.
    
 - readonly fields can only have Get methods since their value is readonly.
