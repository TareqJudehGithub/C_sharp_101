abstract modifier
 - abstract is a modifier of the class.
 - Abstract class is a parent class, of which we cannot instantiate/create
   objects off.
 - abstract prevents a class from being instantiated.
    internal abstract class MyClass {
      // code here
    }
 - It is recommended to abstract parents classes, and instantiate from child ones.
 - We cannot create objects off an abstract class directly.
 - We can add abstract methods in the abstract class.
