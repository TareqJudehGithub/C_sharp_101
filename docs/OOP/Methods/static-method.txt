Static methods
 - Instance method is associated with the object.
 - static method is associated with the class.
 - The instance fields and static fields are both associated to objects.

 - A class can contain two types of methods: instance and static.
  - instance methods are not declared with the 'static' modifier.
  - static methods are declared with 'static' modifier.
  - this keyword is only available inside instance methods; because
    this keyword refers to the current object when calling the method.
  - static methods cannot use this keyword; because there is no 
    current object to refer to when calling the method.

  When to use static and when to use instance methods?
   - When we need to manipulate fields, we should use instance methods.
   - Use static methods for manipulating static fields.
