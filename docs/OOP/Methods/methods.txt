Methods
 
 - Method is function (group of statements) to do some action.
 - Method is part of the class.
 - Method receives inputs (arguments).
 - Method returns values based on arguments given.

    class Car 
    {
      int calculateEmi(int carPrice, int noOfMonths, int interestRate)
      {
        // do calculation (action)
        return someValue;
      }
    }
  - In our example, (int carPrice, int noOfMonths, int interestRate) are
    called method parameters.
  - Parameters can be of any primitive and non-primitive type.
  - To execute methods, we need to call them
        calculateEmi(1000, 12, 7.5);
  
 - method syntax
      accessModifier modifier returnType methodName(params)
      {

      }
  - returnType should match the method return value.
  - void dataType indicates that a method does not return any dataType.

  Local Variables vs Parameters
   - All Variables declares inside a method are called local variables.
   - Parameters receive value from the method arguments when calling the 
     method.
   - Both local variables and parameters are stored inside the stack.
   - Every time a method is being called, a new stack is created for that
     method.
   - After finishing executing the method, the stack will be removed and 
     deleting all local variables and parameters stored there.
   - Parameters can be primitive and non primitive types.
