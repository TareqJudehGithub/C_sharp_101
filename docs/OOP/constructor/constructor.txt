Constructor
 What is a constructor?
  - A special method of the class, which initializes the fields of the class.
  - The constructor can have any additional initialization logic that helps in 
    creating an object for the class.

 Rules of a constructor
  - When creating the constructor, that constructor should have the class name
    as it's name as well.
        public class Car {
          // fields

          // constructor
          public Car() 
          {

          }
        }
  - The constructor access modifiers are same as the fields.
    - private, protected, private protected, Internal, Internal protected, and public.
  - It is recommended to create the constructor with internal or public access modifiers.
  - The constructor has only modifier:  static  or (default no keyword).

  - A constructor does not return any value.
  - A constructor can receive one or more parameter optionally.
  - Inside the constructor we can initialize the declared in the class.
  
  - If the developer does not create an constructor, the complier automatically
    creates a default constructor with no parameters.
  - We can create multiple constructors in the same class.
  - All constructors in the same class, must have different types parameters 
    and fields.
