Properties
 - Properties were introduced in c# 3.0
 - A composite member of the class.
 - Properties check the incoming value whether it is valid or invalid, and assign
   the value into the corresponding field only if the value is valid.

 - Properties expose fields safely, preventing direct access to their corresponding
   fields; because the fields only store values and cannot validate on it's own.
 - Properties naming convention starts with an uppercase (pascal naming).

 - Properties contain two accessors: set and get.
 - Properties syntax:
            private into height;
            public int Height
            {
                get
                {
                    return this.height;
                }
                set
                {
                    this.height = value;
                }
 - set accessor 
    - The set accessor sets the value of the field.
    - Validates the incoming value and initializing it to its corresponding
      field.
    - We can check any custom logic to the set accessor, to check whether the value
      is valid or invalid.  
    - Can't have any additional parameter nor it returns any values.

 - the 'value' keyword in set:
  - A predefined and default implicit parameter which represents the value of the 
  assigned to the property.
  

- get accessor
    - The get accessor return the value of the field.
    - Will be executed automatically when accessing the property.

- Properties and fields share the same access modifiers.
 - private, protected, private protected, internal, protected internal, and public.
- Properties modifiers:
 - static, virtual, abstract, override, new, and sealed.

- No memory will be allocated for the property (will not be stored). 
- The memory will be allocated only for the fields inside the object.
- If we assigned values directly to fields inside a constructor, that will skip the 
  properties and therefor the fields can be accessed directly.
