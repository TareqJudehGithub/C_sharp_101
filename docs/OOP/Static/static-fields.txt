static fields
 - static fields, are fields declared outside the class with 'static' keyword.
 
 - static fields are stored outside the object in the class memory. 
 - Inside the class memory, all the static fields are stored.
 - static fields are not stored in the object heap memory.

 - static fields are common (have access) to all objects in the class.
 - static fields values are not constant, they can be modified anytime.

  class BankAccount 
  {
    long accountNo;
    string accountHoldName;
    double currentBalance;
    static string bankName;
  }

  Objects in Heap:
   accountNo: 1001
   accountHoldName: Scott
   currentBalance: 5000
  
  - while the static field is stored in the class memory in the heap.

Storage            Stored in Objects              Stored in class memory  (both are stored in the heap)

Related to         represents data related        represents common data that belongs to 
                   to objects.                    all objects in the class.

Declaration        long accountNo;                static long accountNo; 

Accessible with    through object only.           Accessible with class name only
                   (through reference variable)   (not with objects).
                   To access from outside the     ClassName.fieldName;
                   class, we need to create an 
                   object, object reference and 
                   storing it in a variable (
                  reference variable).
                  string client1 = objectName.field
