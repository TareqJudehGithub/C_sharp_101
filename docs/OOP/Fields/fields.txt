Fields
 
  Understanding Fields
   - A field is a variable declared in the class, but stored inside the object.
   - Fields stores data in their respective class.
   - Field Syntax:
        public class Employee 
        {
          public string firstName;
          public string lastName;
        }
  - Fields are accessible using the dot . operator
        objectName.fieldName

   - It is not a good habit to initialize values for fields; because field is shared
     for all objects, and every object should have it's own separate value.
   - It is recommended to assign fields as private, so no body can access them from
     outside the class.

   - There are two type of fields:
      - instance
       - instance field belong to it's object declared in the constructor.

      - static, const, and readonly
       - static, const, and readonly are common to all objects.

  Syntax of Fields
   accessModifier Modifier(optional) dataType fieldName;

       Product product1 = new Product();
        - product1 is a reference variable which access the object.
        - product1 is stored in the stack.
        

   - Field access modifiers:
    private, protected, private protected, internal, protected internal, and public.
    - Field default access modifier is private.
    - For private fields, it is recommended to start naming them with an underscore _
        private int _id;
   
   - Field modifiers:
    static, const, and readonly 
    static
     - static fields are common to all objects.
     - Accessible with class name.
    const
     - const field's value cannot be modified
     - compiler replaces all const names with respective values.
     - const is by default "static"
    readonly
     - readonly field's value cannot be modified.
     - compilation-time restriction only.
