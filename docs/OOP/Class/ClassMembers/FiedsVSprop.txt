Difference between fields and properties
  - Fields are like variables, while properties are like methods.
  - Fields has a single access modifier, while properties can have separate access 
    modifiers for getter ans setter.
  - unlike fields, properties can be overridden in derived classes.
  - Fields should always set to private, we should only expose them outside the class
    through their properties.
