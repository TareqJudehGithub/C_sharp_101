Static methods
 - static method/classes are like Console() class.
 - static method is associated with the class, while instance method is associated
   with the object.
 - Because static methods belong to a class, they do not have access to objects data.
 - The instance fields and static fields are both associated to objects.

 - A class can contain two types of methods: instance and static.
  - static methods are declared with 'static' modifier.
  - Instance methods are not declared with the 'static' modifier.
  - The 'this' keyword is only available inside instance methods; because
    'this' keyword refers to the current object when calling the method.
  - static methods cannot use 'this' keyword; because there is no 
    current object to refer to when calling the method.
  - A static class cannot be instantiated creating new objects out of it.
  - *** Static methods and properties cannot access non-static fields.

  When to use static and when to use instance methods?
   - When we need to manipulate fields, we should use instance methods.
   - Use static methods for manipulating static fields.
