Named Arguments
 - Named Arguments feature was introduced in c# 4.0
 - Named Arguments is when we include parameter name along with its 
   value when calling the method.
 - Named arguments improves readability specially if a method contains
   many parameters.
        public void TaxAmount(double price, double percentage = 0.16) // default parameter value.
        {
            double taxAmount = price * percentage;
            Console.Write($"Tax amount = {taxAmount:C0}");
        }
        gmc.TaxAmount(price: gmc.GetPrice(), percentage: 0.1);
