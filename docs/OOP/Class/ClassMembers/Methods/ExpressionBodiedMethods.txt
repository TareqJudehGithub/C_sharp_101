Expression Bodied Methods
 - A statement does something but does not evaluate to a value.
 - In Expression-bodied Methods, we use => and braces instead of curly braces and 
   the enter keyword.
 - We can only use Expression-bodied Methods if the method body contains only
   one expression or one statement.
   
  Example:  Console.WriteLine("Hello world!");
 - An expression is something that evaluates to a value.
  Example: 1 + 2


  Embodied-method example
   public string GreetUser() => "Hello World!";
