Instance constructor VS Static Constructor
 
 - Instance constructor
  - created without the use of a modifier.
  - Initializes instance fields, but can still access static fields.
  - Executes every time when we create a new object for the class.
  - The instance constructor is private by default.
  - We can include any additional logic that needs to be executed 
    when we create objects.


 - Static Constructor
  - Created using static modifier.
  - Used for initializing static fields, and cannot access instance fields.
  - Cannot have any parameters.
  - Cannot return any value.
  - Cannot use the 'this' keyword.
  
  - Will not executes when creating a new object for the class.
  - Executes only one time when the first object is created for the class, or
    when the class is accessed for the first time in the main method.
  - The static constructor is public by default.  
  - any additional logic will be executed once, when the class is accessed for
    for the first time.
