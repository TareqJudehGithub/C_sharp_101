Object Initializer
 - A special syntax in C# to initialize fields or properties of a class
   when a new Object is created for the class.
   
 - Object initializer is an alternative to the constructor, but it does
   not replaces it. We should have a parameter-less constructor declared.
 - Object initializer executes after the constructor finishes executing.
 - Object initializer cannot contain any initialization logic for the class.

 - Use Object Initializer in case we need only to initialize certain fields
   defined in the constructor and not all of the fields initialized in that
   constructor.

 - Object initializer syntax:
      new ClassName()  
      // These curly braces below are called Object Initializer 
      {
        field1 = value;
        field2 = value;
      }
