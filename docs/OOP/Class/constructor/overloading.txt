Constructors Overloading
 - When we declare/define two or more constructors in the same class, we call
   this technique 'Constructors Overloading'.
    class ClassName()
    {
    }
    class ClassName(param1, param2)
    {

    }
  
  - Every constructor should have different parameters than the other in order
    to have constructor overloading.
