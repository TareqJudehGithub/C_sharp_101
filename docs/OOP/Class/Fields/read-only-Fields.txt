readonly fields
 - readonly fields are instance fields with their values cannot be modified.
 - readonly fields are stored inside the object only.
 - Immutable means, once an object is created, it will never be modified.
 - readonly fields cannot be created inside constructors.
 readonly syntax:
  AccessModifer readonly dataType fieldName = value;

 - readonly fields ares accessed with their objects through their reference
   variables.
    objectName.variableName;
 - readonly fields must be initialized upon declaration wether it is a member or it was 
   inside a constructor.
 - In OOP, we call methods by their object reference variable names.
   Product product1 = new Product();
   product1.MethodName();


 * Good practice make fields readonly if possible.
 * We use readonly fields when we want a field never to change after it has been set
   in the constructor.
