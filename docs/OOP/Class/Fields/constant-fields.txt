Constant fields (const keyword)
 - const modifier can be applied to both variables and fields.
 - like static fields, constant fields are common to all objects in the class.
 - Constant fields MUST be initialized upon declaration.

 - All const fields are implicitly static.  
 - Constant fields are fixed (immutable) values and cannot be modified after initialization.
 - like static fields, constant fields are accessed using it's class name, and
   not the object.

 - A constant is declared with const keyword.  
      private const fieldDataType FieldName = value;
      private const float PI = 3.14;
 - const variables conviction is PascalCase.
 - Constant fields are common to all objects, because it's memory is not stored 
   inside any object.
   
 - Constant variables are not stored anywhere; because the constants are replaced
   with actual values always.
 - During compilation, constants names are replaced with their initial values.
 - constants cannot be reference variables.
 - Events and properties cannot be defined as constants.
  const syntax
   accessModifier const type fieldName = value;
 
 * We use 'const' for things with a constant value, known at compilation time. 
   For example i.e cont float PI = 3.14f;
