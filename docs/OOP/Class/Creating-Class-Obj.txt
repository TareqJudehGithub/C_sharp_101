Creating a Class

- Inside the class, We declare the class members:

  AccessModifier modifier class ClassName {
    Fields
    Methods
    Constructors
    Properties
    Events
    Destructors
  }

// Access Modifiers 
 - Internal
  - an internal class is accessible with the same project.
  - A class by default has internal access right.

 - Public
  - a public class is accessible inside and outside the project.

Solution
 - A collection of projects.

Assembly
 - The compiled source code of a project is known as "assembly".
