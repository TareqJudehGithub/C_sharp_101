Interface
 - An interface is a set of abstract methods that must be implemented by the child
   classes.
 - An interface is another way of defining classes.
 - The idea behind interfaces, is to define fields, methods, and constructors in 
   the child classes.
 - An interface we can only define abstract methods (normal methods not allowed).
 - Interfaces are similar to abstract classes, but interfaces contain only abstract 
   methods and property declarations.
 - We can’t create other members such as Fields, normal methods, constructors, properties
   etc., in interface.
 - It is recommended to start the name of the interface with “I”.
 - The default access modifier of all interfaces is public.
 - Just like abstract classes, we cannot create objects off interfaces.

 - An interface cannot contain fields or constructors.
 - An interface can only contain abstract methods.
 - Interface methods are public and abstract by default.
 - For properties members, only their names are defined in the interface, while
   the properties body (accessor) are define in the child class.
 - fields, properties, and constructors are implemented in child classes, which
   gives these child classes the freedom to define it's own logic and statements
   for each child class.
   // interface
   string EmployeeName { set; get; }
   // child class
   string EmployeeName {
      set { this._employeeName = value;}
      get { return this._employeeName; 
      }
   }
 
 - As an interface naming convention, an interface always start with a capital I, and
   also the interface .cs file name should start with an I.
 - We cannot change the access modifier of an interface method.
   // Creating abstract method in the parent interface.
    interface IMyInterface {
      // method name (no body and no access modifier)  // abstract word is not needed.
      void MethodName(param1, param2, ..);
    }
 
 - child classes can inherit from an interface parent.
 - ALL child classes MUST implement all abstract methods define in an interface.
 - Methods implemented in child classes, should have the same name, return type, 
   parameters, And the access modifier must be public.
 
   // Creating a child class that will implement the interface.
   class childName: IMyInterface
   {
      public void MethodName(param1, param2, ..)
      {
         // method body 
      }
   } 
 - No need to write the 'override' key word in child class abstract methods in 
   interfaces.
 - A child class can inherit multiple interfaces.
 - An interface can be a child of another interface (interface inheritance).    
 - An interface cannot be a child of parent class (only parent interface).
