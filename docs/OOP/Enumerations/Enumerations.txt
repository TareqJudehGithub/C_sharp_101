Enumerations
 - Enumerations are strongly typed constants.
 - Created with enum keyword.
 - A Enumeration is a set of named constants.
 - Each value is associated with an integer value.
 - Enumerations follow the pascal naming convention.
 - Base class for all enumerations.
 - Enumeration provides useful methods:
   IsDefined, GetValues, Parse, TryParse, ToObject.
 - After creating an enum, create a default element associated with the value 0.
   It is useful when you instantiate the enum with a new expression to avoid errors.

 {

  Mars,
  Jupiter,

  Neptune,
  Uranus
 }
