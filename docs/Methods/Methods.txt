Methods
 - Methods are blocks of codes that perform specific tasks or actions.
 - Methods encapsulate functionality intro reusable units, which makes our code more
   organize, readable, and maintainable.
 
 - Syntax
    access_modifier return_type method_name(parameters)
    {
      // method body
    }

 - Calling Methods
  - To call an instance method, first we need to create an object of the class.
  - We instantiate a new object (instance) using the 'new' keyword.
    Syntax:
      Program newInstance = new Program();
      - Now, we have a new object called newInstance which can access all the members
        of the class it was instantiated from.
