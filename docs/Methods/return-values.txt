Return values
 - Some methods are designed to complete their function, and end "quietly". they 
   don't return values when they finish. They are referred to as void methods.
 -  A return value is a primary way a method can communicate back to the code that 
    calls the method.
 - A method can be designed to return any data type, even another class.
 - The Random.Next() method returns an int value of the randomly generated number.

- Methods Input parameters
 - Some methods are designed to accept no input parameters. These methods need no 
   additional input to complete their task.
 - Other methods are designed to accept one or more input parameters. 
      int roll = dice.Next(1, 7);
 - Input parameters are defined using a data type. We can't pass values of a 
   different data type as input parameters and expect the method to work.
