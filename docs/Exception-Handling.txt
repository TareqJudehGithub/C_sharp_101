Exception Handling

  try
   - The try block of code test the code for errors.
   
  catch
   - Catches any errors without breaking the program.

  throw;
   - Kills the program displaying the error log to the user/developer.
      catch (FormatException formatError)
      {
          Console.WriteLine($"Invalid format type\n{formatError.Message}");
      }

  finally
   - Wether any of the try or the catch is successful, run the code inside 
     finally block.
