C# Variables naming conventions

Variable name rules
  - Variable names can contain alphanumeric characters and the underscore character. 
  - Special characters like the pound #, the dash -, and the dollar sign $ are not 
    allowed.
  - Variable names must begin with an alphabetical letter or an underscore, not a number.
  - Variable names must NOT be a C# keyword.
  - Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning that string MyValue; and string myValue; 
    are two different variables.

Variable name conventions
 Conventions are suggestions that are agreed upon by the software development community. 

 Variable name conventions
  - Variable names should use camel case.  string firstName;
  - Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful in your application.
  - Variable names should be one or more entire words appended together. 
  - Variable names shouldn't include the data type of the variable.
