What is a computer language
 - Computer stores data in binary format (0s and 1s), storing all characters entered
   by the user.
 - O and 1 came from the electricity switch icons On and Off (0 and 1)
 - Each letter has a binary number.
 - Binary language is a low-level language; because it directly interacts with the 
   computer hardware.
 - Other programming languages are considered a high-level languages; because they
   operate on top of the binary language.
 - An Intermediate Component (a compiler) translates the high-level language into a machine (binary)  
   language.
