    Custom Types
    C# Allows us to creates variables of our own custom type.
    - Enumerations  - custom value types.
    - Structures    - custom reference type 
    - Interfaces    - custom reference type 
    - Classes       - custom reference type  
    - Records       - custom reference type 
    - Delegates     - custom reference type
