Exception Handling
 - Exceptions is a neat way to handle errors that occur.
 - An exception is an error that occur in our program that returns an
   exception error message interrupting our program.
 
 - Error handling is done by a try/catch block

  try
   - The try block of code test the code for errors.

  catch
   - Catches any errors without breaking the program.

  throw;
   - Kills the program displaying the error log to the user/developer.
      catch (FormatException formatError)
      {
          Console.WriteLine($"Invalid format type\n{formatError.Message}");
      }

  finally
   - Wether any of the try or the catch is successful, run the code inside 
     finally block.
