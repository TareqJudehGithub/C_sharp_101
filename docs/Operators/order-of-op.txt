Order of Operations

 - In math, PEMDAS is an acronym that helps students remember the order in which 
   multiple operations are performed. The order is:
    1. Parentheses (whatever is inside the parenthesis is performed first)
    2. Exponents. In C# we can use System.Math.Pow() method.
    3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
    4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)
