Switch statements
 
  What is the switch statement?
    - switch is a selection statement that chooses a single switch section to execute 
      from a list of candidates based on a pattern match with the match expression.
    - A switch statement includes one or more switch sections. 
    - Each switch section contains one or more case labels (either a case or default label)
      followed by one or more statements. 
    - The switch statement may include at most one default label placed in any switch 
      section.
  
  The switch is best used when:

	you have a single value you want to match against many possible values
	but for any given match, you need to execute a couple of lines of code at most.
