Nullable Types
 - Nullable types allow value types to have a value of null.
 - Explicitly indicate when a value is undefined or missing.
 - Add a ? as a suffix to the data type to indicate a nullable type.
    
    int age;  // Non-nullable int
    int? age; // Nullable int

 - Nullables avoid saving values as zeros.
 - Value types cannot handle null values, so by introducing Null Types, they now can.
