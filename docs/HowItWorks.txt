What is a programming language?
 - Programming languages like C# enable you to write instructions that you want 
   the computer to carry out.
 - Programming is writing instructions that the computer will follow to perform 
   various tasks.
 - Each programming language has a different syntax.
 - A programming language's job is to enable a human to write instructions in a 
   human-readable and understandable way.
 - The instructions you write in a programming language is called 
   "source code", or just "code".  
 -  computer can't understand the code. It first must be compiled into a format 
    that the computer can understand.

 What is compilation?
  - A special program called a compiler converts your source code (high level language) 
    into a different format (machine code - low level language) that is executable by 
    the computer's CPU .
  - High level (C# code) ==> Assembly level (Intermediate language) ==> process level (Machine code)

What is syntax?
- The syntax of a programming language includes the keywords, the operators.
- The operators are those special keyboard characters like the semicolon or parenthesis.
