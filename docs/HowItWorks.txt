What is a programming language?
 - Programming languages like C# enable you to write instructions that you want 
   the computer to carry out.
 - Programming is writing instructions that the computer will follow to perform 
   various tasks.
 - Each programming language has a different syntax.
 - A programming language's job is to enable a human to write instructions in a 
   human-readable and understandable way.
 - The instructions you write in a programming language is called 
   "source code", or just "code".  
 -  computer can't understand the code. It first must be compiled into a format 
    that the computer can understand.

 What is compilation?
  - A special program called a compiler converts your source code (high level language) 
    into a different format (machine code - low level language) that is executable by 
    the computer's CPU .
  - High level (C# code) ==> Assembly level (Intermediate language) ==> process level (Machine code)

What is syntax?
- The syntax of a programming language includes the keywords, the operators.
- The operators are those special keyboard characters like the semicolon or parenthesis.

C# language
  - Released in 2001 by Microsoft.
  - C# is one of the most popular and in demand programming languages.
  - Simple, modern, OOP, and type-safe programming language.
  - Mobile ,desktop, and web apps.
  - Web services and Web sites.
  - Games and VR.
  - Database apps.

.Net
 - A framework (development platform) for for building various application.
 - The .NET Class Library is a collection of thousands of classes containing tens of 
   thousands of methods. Even our data types are part of the .NET Class Library. 
 - .NET Runtime hosts and manages your code as it executes on the end user's computer. 
 - Common Language Runtime (CLR) and a set of class libraries.
    - CLR is the programming (Virtual Machine component) that manages the execution of 
      programs written in any language (C#, F#, or VB) that uses the .NET Framework. 

Explaining "Hello World!" and keywords
  using System;
  namespace Branches
  {
      internal class Program
      {
          static void Main(string[] args)
          {
              Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
          }
      }
  }

 - using System;
  - using keyword is importing other libraries and classes.

 - namespace keyword. 
  - A container/package to organize classes, other namespace, and code.
    - Think of a namespace as the last name, surname or "family name" for a type. 
    - A class contains the code that implements a type. 
    - Classes are organized into namespaces to prevent naming collisions.
    - The namespace helps to make sure no two classes have the same full name.
    - A namespace prevents naming collisions between class names in the .NET Class 
      Library.
  - all of the code inside namespace or any block is hold by curly braces {}
 
 - static void Main(string[] args) 
  - This is the main entry point, where the program will start.

 - class
  - A container for methods that bring functionality to our program.
  - Developers typically keep related methods together in a single class.

 - static
  - The main method above must be static, it cannot be changed.
 - void
  - Meaning this method does not return anything.
 - String[] args
  - String of arrays with unlimited arguments.

- What is a console?
  - An application that uses the command line for input and output rather than a 
    graphical interface (GUI). For example, utility programs that perform a single 
    function or that run in the background are often written as console apps.
  
- There are three structures in C# programming:

  1. Sequence 
    - Sequence is to follow to order from writing code, from top to bottom.
  2. Decision
    - To build logics based on decisions.
  3. Repetition
    - To repeat and same blocks or lines of codes.
