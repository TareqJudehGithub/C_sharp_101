Lists

 - Lists are another object/collection data type in C#.
 - A list stores data of the same type.
 - Unlike Arrays, list can have a dynamic number of data stored.
 - We can add and remove data in Lists using add() and remove() properties.
 - We can iterate over Lists elements using loops (for and foreach).
 - listName.Count returns a integer with the List length.
 - Before Dotnet 6.0, List needs namespace System.Collections.Generic; in
   order to be declared.
