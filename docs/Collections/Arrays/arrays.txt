Arrays
 - An array stores a fixed size sequential collection of data of the same type.
 - We can have any type of arrays (int, string, objects, etc).
 - Arrays use zero indexing to store elements of the same type.
 - The first index in an array is always 0.

 - Arrays syntax
  int[] grades = new int[5]
    - The above syntax creates an new empty array of 5 size elements.
  grade1 = grades[0] = 95;
  grade2 = grades[1] = 86
  grade2 = grades[2] = 79
  grade2 = grades[3] = 91
  grade2 = grades[4] = 93
