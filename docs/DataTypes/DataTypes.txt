C# Data Types
 - A variable in C# must be a specified data type.
 - a data type describes a variable.
    int myNum = 5;               // Integer (whole number)
    double myDoubleNum = 5.99D;  // Floating point number
    char myLetter = 'D';         // Character
    bool myBool = true;          // Boolean
    string myText = "Hello";     // String

 - The most common data types are:

    Data Type	  Size	    Description
    int	        4 bytes	  Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
    long	      8 bytes	  Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
    float	      4 bytes	  Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits
    double	    8 bytes	  Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits
    bool	      1 bit	    Stores true or false values
    char	      2 bytes	  Stores a single character/letter, surrounded by single quotes
    string	    2 bytes per character. Stores a sequence of characters, surrounded by double quotes

 - long data type value ends with an 'L'
    long myNum = 15000000000L;
 - float data type value ends with an 'F'
    float myNum = 5.75F;
   - float is good for performance apps. 
 - double type value ends with an 'D' or nothing at all.
    double myNum = 19.99D;
   - double is the most used floating data type.
 - decimal data type is more precised that double and float ending with an 'M'.
    decimal taxValue = 0.55M;
   - decimal is used for calculation and financial apps. 

 - The precision of float is only six or seven decimal digits, while double variables 
   have a precision of about 15 digits. Therefore it is safer to use double for most 
   calculations.
 
- Scientific Numbers
  A floating point number can also be a scientific number with an "e" to indicate the 
  power of 10:
    Example
    float f1 = 35e3F;
    double d1 = 12E4D;
    Console.WriteLine(f1);
    Console.WriteLine(d1);

- Booleans
  - A boolean data type is declared with the bool keyword and can only take the values 
    true or false.
  - Boolean values are mostly used for conditional testing.
      Example
      bool isCSharpFun = true;
      bool isFishTasty = false;
      Console.WriteLine(isCSharpFun);   // Outputs True
      Console.WriteLine(isFishTasty);   // Outputs False

- Characters
 - The char data type is used to store a single character. The character must be 
   surrounded by single quotes, like 'A' or 'c':

    Example
      char myGrade = 'B';
      Console.WriteLine(myGrade);

- Strings
 - The string data type is used to store a sequence of characters (text). 
 - String values must be surrounded by double quotes:
    Example
    string greeting = "Hello World";
    Console.WriteLine(greeting);

- var (Implicit Data Types Variables)
  - makes declaring variables easier
  - we use the 'var' keyword to implicitly declare a variable
  - Type Inference: 'var' keyword determines the variables assigned value.
  - implicit type variables must be initialized.
  - Implicit type variables cannot be initialed with a null.
