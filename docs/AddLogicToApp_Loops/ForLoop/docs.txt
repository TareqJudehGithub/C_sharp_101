For loop
 - The for statement iterates through a code block a specific number of times. 
 - This makes the for statement unique among the other iteration statements.
 - The foreach statement iterates through a block of code once for each item in a sequence of data like an array or collection. 
 - The while statement iterates through a block of code until a condition is met.
 - The for statement should be used when you know the number of times you need to iterate through a block of code ahead of time.
 - The for statement allows you to control the way in which each iteration is handled. 
 
 - There are six parts to for statement:
  (initializer, condition, and iterator)
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {do something action}
	1. The for keyword
	2. A set of parenthesis that defines the conditions of for iteration. int i = 0;
	3. The condition.	i < 10;
	4. The iterator.	i++
	5. The code block. This is the code that will be executed for each iteration.

Use the break keyword to break the iteration statement
 What if we need to exit the iteration statement prematurely based on some condition? We can use the break keyword.
		for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
		{
			Console.WriteLine(i);
			if (i == 7) break;
		}
