What is whitespace?
 - The term "whitespace" refers to individual spaces produced by the space bar, tabs 
   produced by the tab key, and new lines produced by the enter key.
 - The C# compiler ignores whitespace.
 - Use whitespace judiciously to improve the readability of your code.
 - Use line feeds to create empty lines to separate phrases of code. 
 - A phrase is comprised of lines of code that are similar, or work together.
 - Use line feeds to separate code block symbols so that they are on their own line 
   of code.
 - Use the tab key to line up a code block with the keyword they're associated with.
 - Indent code inside of a code block to show ownership.
 
Early guidance:
- Each complete command (a statement) belongs on a separate line.
- If a single line of code becomes long, you can break it up. However, you should 
  avoid arbitrarily splitting up a single statement to multiple lines until you have 
  a good reason to do so.
- Use a space to the left and right of the assignment operator.
