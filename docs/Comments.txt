What is a code comment?
 - A code comment is an instruction to the compiler to ignore everything after the  
   code comment symbols in the current line.

    // This is a code comment!

 When should we use code comment?
  - When you want to leave a note about the intent of a passage of code. 
  - When you want to temporarily remove code from your application to try a different 
    approach.
  - Adding a message like TODO to remind you to look at a given passage of code later. 


    /* 
    This is a long comment 
    that spans multiple lines
    just to prove that it can
    be done.
