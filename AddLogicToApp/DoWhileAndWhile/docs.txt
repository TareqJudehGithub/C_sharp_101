What is the do-while statement?
- A do-while loop is useful when you want to execute a command at least once.
 - The do statement executes a statement or a block of statements while a specified Boolean expression evaluates to true.
 - Because that expression is evaluated after each execution of the loop, a do-while loop executes one or more times.
 do
{
    // This code executes at least one time
} while (true)

- The flow of execution starts inside of the curly brace. 
- The code executes at least one time, then the Boolean expression next to the while keyword is evaluated. 
- If the Boolean expression returns true, the code block is executed again.
- Once the Boolean expression returns false, the flow of execution will break.
- The while statement evaluates a Boolean expression first, and continues to iterate through the code block as long as the Boolean expression evaluates to true.
- continue skips the next line of code.
- he continue keyword to step immediately to the Boolean expression.
- The break keyword stops executing the while loop entirely and the execution path moves on with the remainder of the 
  code logic.
