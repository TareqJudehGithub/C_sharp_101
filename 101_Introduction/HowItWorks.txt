What is a programming language?
 - Programming languages like C# enable you to write instructions that you want 
   the computer to carry out.
 - Each programming language has a different syntax.
 - A programming language's job is to enable a human to write instructions in a 
   human-readable and understandable way.
 - The instructions you write in a programming language is called 
   "source code", or just "code".  
 -  computer can't understand the code. It first must be compiled into a format 
    that the computer can understand.
 
 What is compilation?
  - A special program called a compiler converts your source code into a different 
    format (machine code) that is executable by the computer's CPU .

What is syntax?
- The syntax of a programming language includes the keywords, the operators.
- The operators are those special keyboard characters like the semicolon or parenthesis.


Explaining "Hello World!" and keywords
  using System;

          {
              Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
          }
      }
  }

 - using System;
  - using keyword is importing other libraries.
 - namespace keyword. 
  - A container/package to organize classes.
  - all of the code inside namespace is hold by curly braces {}
 
 - static void Main(string[] args) 
  - This is the main entry point, where the program will start.

  - The main method above must be static, it cannot be changed.
 - void
  - Meaning this method does not return anything.
