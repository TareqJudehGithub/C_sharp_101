C# Variables

  - Variables are containers for storing data values.

  - In C#, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), 
    for example:
      int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
      double - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
      char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
      string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes
      bool - stores values with two states: true or false

 - To create a variable, you must specify the type and assign it a value:
    string myName = "John Smith";
  - We declared a new variable called myName assigning it the value "John Smith".
  - You can assign different values to any variable you declare.

Constants
 - You can add the const keyword if you don't want others (or yourself) to overwrite 
   existing values (this will declare the variable as "constant", which means 
   unchangeable and read-only):
    const int tax = 0.05;
    tax = 0.10;  //error
 - The const keyword is useful when you want a variable to always store the same value, 
   so that others (or yourself) won't mess up your code.

Example of different variable types declaration in C#
  int myNum = 5;
  double myDoubleNum = 5.99D;
  char myLetter = 'D';
  bool myBool = true;
  string myText = "Hello";

  int x = 5, y = 6, z = 50;
  Console.WriteLine(x + y + z);

  int x, y, z;
  x = y = z = 50;

C# Identifiers
 - All C# variables must be identified with unique names.
 - These unique names are called identifiers.
 - Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, 
   totalVolume). 
 - Note: It is recommended to use descriptive names in order to create understandable 
   and maintainable code:
      // Good
      int minutesPerHour = 60;

      // OK, but not so easy to understand what m actually is
      int m = 60;

The general rules for naming variables are:
  - Names can contain letters, digits and the underscore character (_)
  - Names must begin with a letter
  - Names should start with a lowercase letter and it cannot contain whitespace
  - Names are case sensitive ("myVar" and "myvar" are different variables)
  - Reserved words (like C# keywords, such as int or double) cannot be used as names
