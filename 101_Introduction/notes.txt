What is C# 
  - Websites, web apps, mobile, ML, and gaming.
  - The C# language doesn't treat indentation or white space as significant. 
  - Every C# statement ends with a semicolon;
  - The semi-colon is the end of statement operator.
  - A statement is a complete instruction in C#.
  - The semi-colon tells the compiler that we're finished entering the command.
  - C# is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.
  - In C#, we always capitalize classes and methods. Console.WriteLine();
  - Microsoft Intellisense can help write code more quickly. It provides a quick 
    reference to methods, their return values, their overloaded versions, and the 
    types of their input parameters.
