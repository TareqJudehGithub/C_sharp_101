- using System means that we can use classes from the System namespace.
- namespace is used to organize your code, and it is a container for classes 
  and other namespaces.
- The curly braces {} marks the beginning and the end of a block of code.
- class is a container for data and methods, which brings functionality to your program.
  Every line of code that runs in C# must be inside a class.  In our example, we named 
  the class Program.

- Main method
 - Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed.

- Console is a class of the System namespace, which has a WriteLine() method that is used 
  to output/print text.
