   be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.

    // This is a comment
      Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
 - Multi-line comments start with /* and ends with */
    /* The code below will print the words Hello World
    to the screen, and it is amazing */
    Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
