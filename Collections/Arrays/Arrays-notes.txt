Arrays in C#
 - Arrays allow you to store sequences of values in a single data structure. 
 - An array represents a collection of values.
 - Imagine a single variable that can hold many values.
 - Once you have a single variable that stores all the values, you can sort the 
   values, reverse the order of the values, loop through each value and inspect it 
   individually.
 - Arrays size is fixed and not dynamic.

What is an array?
 - An array is a sequence of individual data elements accessible through a single 
   variable name. 
 - An array is a special type of variable that can hold multiple values of the same 
   data type. 
 - You use a zero-based numeric index to access each element of an array.

    Array example:
      string[] fraudulentOrderIDs = new string[3];  
 - This is a 3 spaces in memory address 0, 1, 2
 - The new operator creates a new instance of an array in the computer's memory that 
   can hold three string values. 

- Assigning Values to Elements of an Array
    fraudulentOrderIDs[0] = "A123";
    fraudulentOrderIDs[1] = "B456";
    fraudulentOrderIDs[2] = "C789";

- Accessing elements in Arrays
    Console.WriteLine(fraudulentOrderIDs[0]);

- Reassign the value of an array
    fraudulentOrderIDs[0] = "F000";


Initializing an Array
 - you can initialize a new array at the time you declare it using a special syntax 
  featuring curly braces.
  string[] fraudulentOrderIDs = {"A123", "B456", "C789"};

- Getting the Size of an Array
 - The Length property gives you a programmatic way to determine the number of 
   elements in an array.
  fraudulentOrderIDs.Length

Looping through an array using foreach
 - The foreach statement loops through each element in an array.
 - The foreach statement sets the value of the current element in the array to a 
   temporary variable, which you can use in the body of the code block.
      foreach (string ID in fraudulentOrderIDs) {
      Console.WriteLine($"ID: {ID}");
      }

  
    int[] invetory = {200, 450, 700, 175, 250};
    int sum = 0;
    int bin = 0;
    // Iterate through array elements using foreach
    foreach (int item in invetory) {
        sum += item;
        bin++;
        Console.WriteLine($"Bin {bin} = {item} item (Running total: {sum})");

    }
    Console.WriteLine($"sum =  {sum}");
