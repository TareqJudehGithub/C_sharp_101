IndexOf() and SubString()

 - IndexOf() method and its variants including IndexOfAny() and LastIndexOf() locate the position of one character or string inside a larger string.
 - Once we've located the position, we can use the Substring() method to return the rest of the string AFTER the position.

 - Substring(starting index, length);
  - When you use Substring() without specifying a length input parameter, it will return every character after the starting position you specify. 

 - LastIndexOf(), which we use to get the positions of the last targeted index.

Retrieve any value between one or more sets of parentheses in a string.

IndexOfAny()
 - IndexOfAny() will return us the first match it finds in the string.
 - The IndexOfAny() helper method requires a char array of characters. 



 Recap
We covered a lot of ground in this unit. Here's the most important things to remember:

IndexOf() gives us the first position of a character or string inside of another string.
IndexOf() returns -1 if it can't find a match.
Substring() returns just the specified portion of a string, using a starting position and optional length.
LastIndexOf() returns the last position of a character or string inside of another string.
IndexOfAny() returns the first position of an array of char that occurs inside of another string.
There's often more than one way to solve a problem. We used two separate techniques to find all instances of a given character or string.
Avoid hardcoded magic values. Instead, define a const variable. A constant variable's value can't be changed after initialization.
