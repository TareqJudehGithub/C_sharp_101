  - A class has actions or abilities. like functions and methods.
  - A class has properties. Like member variables. e.g. string properties.
  - Inheritance is possible in classes.
  - Classes can be used as data type.

Object
 - We can create objects out of a class.
 
 Example of classes and object:
	We can create a 'car' class, and from that car class, we could create new objects.
	Properties like: HP, Wheels, Doors..etc.
	Abilities like: drive, break, open window, light on/off.
	inheritance: A5 < Audi < Car.
