Doubles
 - The double numeric type represents a double-precision floating point number.
 - Doubles hold larger values than integers.



Double data type min and max value
  double a = 10;
  double b = 15;
  double c = b / a;
  double dblMin = double.MaxValue;
  double dblMax = double.MaxValue;

  Console.WriteLine($"The range of double is between {dblMin} and {dblMax}");
  >>>The range of double is between 1.79769313486232E+308 and 1.79769313486232E+308

  double third = 1.0 / 3.0;
  Console.WriteLine(third);
  >>>0.333333333333

  double science = 79;
  double math = 85;
  double biology = 83;
  double physics = 91;
  double marks_total = science + math + biology + physics;
  double score = marks_total / 4;
  Console.WriteLine($"The student scored: {score}");
  >>>The student scored: 85.5


  
  Challenge
    write code that calculates the area of a circle whose radius 
    is 2.50 centimeters.

    area = radius squared multiplied by PI.
    double radius = 2.5;
    Double area = Math.Pow(radius, 2) * Math.PI;
    Console.WriteLine(area);

 - Math is a class in C Sharp.
