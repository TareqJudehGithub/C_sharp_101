if/else statements
 -  A boolean is a variable that can have one of two values: true or false. 
 - An if statement evaluates a boolean expression value.
 - When the value is true, the statement following the if executes. Otherwise, it's 
   skipped.
 - If the boolean expression condition in the if statement was false, then
   the next condition wil be evaluated (the else if).
 - The statement following the else keyword executes only when the condition being 
   tested is false.


    int a = 5;
    int b = 6;

    // Check if a is greater than b
    if (a > b && b >= 1)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{a} is greater than {b}!");
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{b} is greater than {a}");
    }
