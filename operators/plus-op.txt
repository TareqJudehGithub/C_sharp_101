 Mix data types to force implicit type conversions
  int firstNum = 12;
  int secondNum = 7;
  string name = "Bob";

  Console.WriteLine(firstNum + secondNum);
  Console.WriteLine(name + " sold " + (firstNum + secondNum) + " apples.");

 - C# compiler attempts to implicitly convert the int variable into a 
   string temporarily so it can concatenate it to the rest of the string.
 - overloading an operator
  - Add parentheses to make our intention clear to the compiler. 
  - The parentheses symbol () becomes another overloaded operator.
  - We indicate that we want the inner-most parentheses resolved first resulting 
    in the addition of int values (firstNum + secondNum).
