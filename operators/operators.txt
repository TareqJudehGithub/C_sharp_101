C# Operators
 - Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
      int x = 100 + 50;
      int sum1 = 100 + 50;        // 150 (100 + 50)
      int sum2 = sum1 + 250;      // 400 (150 + 250)
      int sum3 = sum2 + sum2;     // 800 (400 + 400)

 - Arithmetic Operators
  - Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations: 

    Operator	Name	            Description	                          Example
    +	     Addition	       Adding values | concatenation(strings) x + y | name + age
    -	     Subtraction	  Subtracts one value from another	      x - y	
    *	     Multiplication	  Multiplies two values	                x * y	
    /	     Division	       Divides one value by another	      x / y	
    %	     Modulus	       Returns the division remainder	      x % y	
    ++	     Increment	       Increases the value of a variable by   x++	
    --	     Decrement	       Decreases the value of a variable by   x--

 - Assignment Operators (compound assignment operators)
 4569* int x = 10;
 - The addition assignment operator += adds (increment) a value to a variable:
      x += 5;
 
      A list of all assignment operators:
      Operator	Example	     Same As	
      =	      x = 5	     x = 5	
      +=	      x += 3	     x = x + 3	
      -=	      x -= 3	     x = x - 3	
      *=	      x *= 3	     x = x * 3	
      /=	      x /= 3	     x = x / 3	
      %=	      x %= 3	     x = x % 3	
      &=	      x &= 3	     x = x & 3	
      |=	      x |= 3	     x = x | 3	
      ^=	      x ^= 3	     x = x ^ 3	
      >>=	      x >>= 3	     x = x >> 3	
      <<=	      x <<= 3	     x = x << 3	
      --        x = x - 1     x--
      ++        x = x + 1     x++

 - C# Comparison Operators
  - Comparison operators are used to compare two values:

      Operator	Name	                      Example
      ==	      Equal to	                  x == y	
      !=	      Not equal	                  x != y	
      >	        Greater than	              x > y	
      <	        Less than	                  x < y	
      >=	      Greater than or equal to	  x >= y	
      <=	      Less than or equal to	      x <= y	

 - C# Logical Operators
  - Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values:
  - Logical operators checks two expressions.

      Operator	Name	        Description	    
                                              Example	
      && 	      Logical and	  Returns true if both statements are true	              x < 5 &&  x < 10	
      &                         Checks also the right operand if the left is false.
      || 	      Logical or	  Returns true if one of the statements is true	          x < 5 || x < 4	
      !	      Logical not	  Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true	!(x < 5 && x < 10)
      ! is also called negation operator.
      
- % the remainder
  -The remainder operator % tells you the remainder of int division.
